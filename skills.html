    <h2>CREATIVITY</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Creativity to me, is the ability to think outside the box and come up with original ideas. Be open to just playing , experimenting, enjoying, messing up and trying again. Creativity works best if you do it for the love of it rather than to be perfect.</p></li>

Be always aware of why you should take specific actions and where they will lead you. Goals allow youn to measure progress</p></li>
